## Description
Using basic Javascript to build a website which manipualted the Dom.  The finalised product was to create a quiz to assist students undertaking IT studies.  Additional features include a score tally and a timer counting down after a "start" button is clicked. Questions were designed in a multiple choice format in the form of, What is an Array?, Which of the following statements defines an Object?.

## Approach
Using the DOM techniques shown I started by manually creating the html by using javascript then proceeded to creating the timer.  However, I kept having continuos errors with only one function wanting to work at a time.  To solve this I decided to abandon coding the timer to work and domonstrate my understanding of it using pseudocode as I found DOM manipulation difficult, frustrating and annoying.  

### STEP TWO
The next task was to append links to the next webpage so that each point had a button attached which was linked to the next page and if more time allowed I would also have tried to pass a function to equate them to a boolean function.  
Once this process was done I then moved to demonstrate  my understanding of local storage by completing the result page with its script to demonstrate understanding of saving and calling from local storage which took more time then realised but in doing so it has increased my understanding of doing this particular topic

##### Discussion
I did not enjoy this topic and type/style of coding due to the ungodly amount of errors and coding accuracy required even in troubleshooting when one issue was solved another one appeared and for me this was only from 30 lines of code.  When I changed tactic to one script page max 30ish lines per html this appeared to solve one issue but it meant I would be unable to accurately code a timer.  Which I was ok with.  The idea for this can be found in webpages/timer pseudocode.

#### Usage
The site is deployed however is incomplete and not available for use it will be reviewed and possibly updated to a more modern standard and design.

#### Testing
Due to the nature of manipulating the DOM with basic Javascript I struggled greatly and was unable to accurately test my functions and returns due to time constraints and confusion of this particular topic.
