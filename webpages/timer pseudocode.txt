In order for the api's to work with minimal bugs or error which has been a massive headache, the solution was a JS module approach.
One js file per webpage with an import of the timer function to keep track of the timer value.   


Thus, for the timer to work accurately the following will need to be done.
BEGIN
    WHEN START QUIZ Btn is clicked, 
    window.onload of QuestionOne.html () {
        BEGIN function
            setInterval (function {
                reduce timer count by 1 each second;
                if (list link is clicked) {
                    save count value to local storage;
                }
                if (false link is clicked) {
                    transfer to next page count = count - 15;
                }
                if (count === 0) {
                    jump to result.html;
                    clearInterval;
                }
            }, 1000)
        }
        END function

The following would be programmed for questionTwo.html through to questionFive.html;
BEGIN   
    window.onload of QuestionX.html () {
        count = window.getLocalStorage(count.value);
            setInterval (function {
                reduce timer count by 1 each second;

                if ( correct list link is clicked) {
                    save count value to local storage;
                }
                
                if (wrong link is clicked) {
                    transfer to next page count = count - 15;
                    setLocalStorage(count.value);
                }
                
                if (count === 0) {
                    jump to result.html
                    clearInterval
                }
            }, 1000)
        }
    }
END
