GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

WIll Need two files, script.js, html webpage(s)?, will need to take things slow and focus on one elemetn at a time.
PsudoCode Plan:
Step 1
Start number linked with a setInterval to act as a timer and a question pops up.
For the questions use a object for questions with an array for potential answers, if this does not work then equate the answers array to the question for display.  

Step 2, ON selecting an answer there wil be a link or change to the next webpage displaying another question and if the answer is wrong will need following in code -
if (answer variable is wrong) {
    setInterval -15 seconds from timer.
}

STEP 3:
Game over screen if all answers are answered correctly or timer count = 0.

Step 4
able to save initials and name to the local storage using:
localStorage etc.
